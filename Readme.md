# Status
Please note that the only thing working at the moment is the containerization of the Blazor client and the WebAPI, but the Blazor containerization is a working wonder in itself, and it is also therefore I am making this public now. Use the Blazor app itself to see just what to do to get a blazor served from a docker app (by nginx).

# Description
This project is a test client that uses the stack as a backend, https://github.com/mslot/stack. This project has a working webapi that is going to be used by the Blazor client.
